                            Platform9 enables a public cloud experience on any infrastructure. The product offering
                            I spent most of my time on was Platform9 Managed Kubernetes (PMK).

                            I maintained close contact with the Platform9 team throughout the years and enjoyed
                            working there so I ended up going back to work there again. The 2nd time around the
                            UI team was a little bigger but had been lacking senior UI leadership for quite some
                            time. The codebase had become unwieldy and was based on Angular v1. Working with
                            senior management I led the effort to modernize the tech stack from Angular v1 to
                            modern React as well as adding new features along the way.

                            Badgeville is a rapidly growing Ruby on Rails tech startup. It provides a SaaS
                            based gamification platform through a RESTful API. The game dynamics (custom rules)
                            customers use can be quite complex. As a result, there can be upward of 100 database
                            queries per API call. The high degree of concurrent requests were causing data
                            corruption due to race conditions. Rapid customer acquisition and a large backlog
                            of product features were constrained by what engineering could provide. Feature
                            development and maintenance were taking longer due to the codebase becoming unwieldy.
                            Additionally, a large portion of the development team were junior developers.
                            These factors limited growth, were cost prohibitive, and created scaling challenges.

                            HiView was an integrated development environment for programmers to write software for the Hitachi H8
                            and SH microprocessors in C and assembly. Hardware emulators and development kits allowed running and
                            debugging cross-platform code on actual hardware. Targeted applications included console video games
                            (SEGA Genesis / Dreamcast), cell phones, and embedded electronic devices.
